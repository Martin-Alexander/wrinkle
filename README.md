# Wrinkle

ðŸš§Work in progressðŸš§

A PostgreSQL database as a service where all user data is persisted in my brain.

- **Reliability**: Extremely low. Uptime dependent on my schedule and willingness to respond to queries.
- **Data Integrity**: Extremely low. Even very minimal amounts of data complexity will be difficult for me to remember.
- **Performance**: Extremely low. Response times will typically on the order of minutes or hours depending on my schedule and the complexity of the data and query.
- **Scalability**: Extremely low. See *Data Integrity* and *Performance*
- **Security**: SCRAM-SHA-256 client authentication not supported
- **Features**: Otherwise full compatibility with PostgreSQL 17.5
